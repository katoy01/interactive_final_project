# Let's Grow!

## Grow your Farm Restaurant!

Hi, my name is Yoshiaki Kato, and this is a video game I made with my friend Tone Nana.
Inspired by the indie game "Stardew Valley," I teamed up with my project partner to make an adorable and cozy 
game that included the elements of farming, and cooking. 
I managed most of the programming and I relied on my partner to create the map and find a bunch of free (and paid) 
visual, and audio assets. 
I added many loving details to this project and hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
